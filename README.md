# AtlasC2-docked
this is a dockerization project
Grimmie made AtlasC2 Framework, for a pure windows environment thus far
i ported it to linux (server and client, i mean we want it on kali...)
the implant still needs to be compiled on windows
this C2 has a different focus, appreciate it, dig it, groove on it
if you like what i've done here, feel free to support Grimmie's fundraising efforts

I WANNA SEE THIS GROW
I containerized v1, imagine what's to come...
